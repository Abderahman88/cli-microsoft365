Depending on the command you want to use, you might be required to log in to a SharePoint Online tenant admin site (suffixed with -admin , eg. https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com ) or a regular site. By default, the spo login command uses device code OAuth flow to log in to SharePoint Online. Alternatively, you can authenticate using a user name and password, which is convenient for CI/CD scenarios, but which comes with its own limitations. See the Office 365 CLI manual for more information. When logging in to a SharePoint site, the spo login command stores in memory the access token and the refresh token for the specified site. Both tokens are cleared from memory after exiting the CLI or by calling the spo logout command. When logging in to SharePoint Online using the user name and password, next to the access and refresh token, the Office 365 CLI will store the user credentials so that it can automatically reauthenticate if necessary. Similarly to the tokens, the credentials are removed by reauthenticating using the device code or by calling the spo logout command.

Depending on the command you want to use, you might be required to log in to a SharePoint Online tenant admin site (suffixed with -admin , eg. https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com ) or a regular site. By default, the spo login command uses device code OAuth flow to log in to SharePoint Online. Alternatively, you can authenticate using a user name and password, which is convenient for CI/CD scenarios, but which comes with its own limitations. See the Office 365 CLI manual for more information. When logging in to a SharePoint site, the spo login command stores in memory the access token and the refresh token for the specified site. Both tokens are cleared from memory after exiting the CLI or by calling the spo logout command. When logging in to SharePoint Online using the user name and password, next to the access and refresh token, the Office 365 CLI will store the user credentials so that it can automatically reauthenticate if necessary. Similarly to the tokens, the credentials are removed by reauthenticating using the device code or by calling the spo logout command.","title":"Remarks"},{"location":"cmd/spo/login/#examples","text":"Log in to a SharePoint Online tenant admin site using the device code spo login https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com Log in to a SharePoint Online tenant admin site using the device code in debug mode including detailed debug information in the console output spo login --debug https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com Log in to a regular SharePoint Online site using the device code spo login https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team Log in to a SharePoint Online tenant admin site using a user name and password spo login https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com --authType password --userName user@contoso.com --password pass@word1","title":"Examples"},{"location":"cmd/spo/logout/","text":"spo logout Log out from SharePoint Online Usage spo logout [ options ] Alias spo disconnect Options Option Description --help output usage information -o, --output [output] Output type. json|text .

If the scope has to be changed, then the existing custom action should be removed and new should be added with different scope.","title":"Remarks"},{"location":"cmd/spo/customaction/customaction-set/#examples","text":"Updates tenant-wide SharePoint Framework Application Customizer extension properties in site https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test spo customaction set -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -i 058140e3-0e37-44fc-a1d3-79c487d371a3 -p { testMessage : Test message } Updates tenant-wide SharePoint Framework modern List View Command Set extension in site https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test spo customaction set -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -i 058140e3-0e37-44fc-a1d3-79c487d371a3 -p { sampleTextOne : One item is selected in the list. , sampleTextTwo : This command is always visible. } --sequence 100 Updates url custom action in the SiteActions menu in site https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test spo customaction set -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -i 058140e3-0e37-44fc-a1d3-79c487d371a3 --actionUrl ~site/SitePages/Home.aspx Updates ScriptLink custom action with script source in classic pages in site collection https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test spo customaction set -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -i 058140e3-0e37-44fc-a1d3-79c487d371a3 --scriptSrc ~sitecollection/SiteAssets/YourScript.js Creates custom action with delegated rights in the SiteActions menu in site https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test spo customaction set -u https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/test -i 058140e3-0e37-44fc-a1d3-79c487d371a3 --rights AddListItems,DeleteListItems,ManageLists","title":"Examples"},{"location":"cmd/spo/customaction/customaction-set/#more-information","text":"UserCustomAction REST API resources: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn531432.aspx#bk_UserCustomAction UserCustomAction Locations and Group IDs: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb802730.aspx UserCustomAction Element: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ms460194.aspx UserCustomAction Rights: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/microsoft.sharepoint.spbasepermissions.aspx","title":"More information"},{"location":"cmd/spo/externaluser/externaluser-list/","text":"spo externaluser list Lists external users in the tenant Usage spo externaluser list [ options ] Options Option Description --help output usage information -f, --filter [filter] Limits the results to only those users whose first name, last name or email address begins with the text in the string, using a case-insensitive comparison -p, --pageSize [pageSize] Specifies the maximum number of users to be returned in the collection.

If you're building a script with steps that require the site to be fully provisioned, you should use the --wait flag.

Before you can execute any of the commands in the CLI, you have to log in to the Office 365 service corresponding to your command, such as SharePoint or Microsoft Graph. TL;DR Use Auth.ensureAccessToken when: the URL of the service to which you are logged in and the URL of the API you're communicating with are the same, eg. you're connected to AAD Graph at https://graph.windows.net and you're calling https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/servicePrincipals or you're connected to SharePoint tenant admin site at https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com and you're calling the tenant admin API at https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery you want to renew the refresh token persisted in the Office 365 CLI Use Auth.getAccessToken when: the URL of the service to which you are logged in and the URL of the API you're calling are different, eg. you're connected to a SharePoint Online tenant admin site at https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com , but you're calling https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team/_api/web/tenantappcatalog/AvailableApps/GetById('cd807889-9107-416e-88e4-7575789ab35c')/install to install an app on a regular SharePoint site you're obtaining access token for a service different than the one to which you are logged in and don't want to break the existing connection Authorization in the Office 365 CLI There are a number of ways in which you can authenticate and authorize with Office 365. The Office 365 CLI uses the OAuth protocol to authorize with Office 365 and its services. OAuth flows in Office 365 are facilitated by Azure Active Directory. Azure AD application used by the Office 365 CLI Office 365 CLI gets access to Office 365 through a custom Azure AD application named PnP Office 365 Management Shell . If you don't want to consent this application in your tenant, you can use a different application instead. When specifying a custom Azure AD application to be used by the Office 365 CLI, you can either choose to use one application for all Office 365 services or a separate application for each service. To use one Azure AD application for all Office 365 CLI commands, set the OFFICE365CLI_AADAPPID environment variable to the ID of your Azure AD application. If you want to use a different Azure AD application for each Office 365 service use the following environment variables: OFFICE365CLI_AADAADAPPID - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with Azure AD Graph OFFICE365CLI_AADAZMGMTAPPID - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with the Azure Management Service OFFICE365CLI_AADGRAPHAPPID - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with the Microsoft Graph OFFICE365CLI_AADSPOAPPID - for the ID of the Azure AD application to communicate with SharePoint Online Office 365 CLI requires the following permissions to Office 365 services: Office 365 SharePoint Online (Microsoft.SharePoint) Have full control of all site collections Read user profiles Read and write managed metadata Microsoft Graph Invite guest users to the organization Read and write all groups Read and write directory data Access directory as the signed in user Read and write identity providers Send mail as a user Windows Azure Active Directory Access the directory as the signed-in user Windows Azure Service Management API Access Azure Service Management as organization users Attention After changing the ID of the Azure AD application used by the Office 365 CLI refresh the existing connections to Office 365 using the corresponding service connect command. If you try to use the existing connection, Office 365 CLI will fail when trying to refresh the existing access token. Access and refresh tokens in the Office 365 CLI After completing the OAuth flow, the CLI receives from Azure Active Directory a refresh- and an access token. Each web request to Office 365 APIs contains the access token which authorizes the Office 365 CLI to execute the particular operation. When the access token expires, the CLI uses the refresh token to obtain a new access token. When the refresh token expires, the user has to reauthenticate to Office 365 to obtain a new refresh token. Services and commands Each command in the Office 365 CLI belongs to a service, for example the spo site add command, which creates a new modern site, belongs to the SharePoint Online service, while the aad sp get command, which lists Azure Active Directory service principals, belongs to the Azure Active Directory Graph service. Each service in Office 365 is a different Azure Active Directory authorization resource and requires a separate access token. When working with the CLI, you can be simultaneously connected to multiple services. Each command in the CLI knows which Office 365 service it communicates with and for which resource it should have a valid access token. Communicating with Office 365 Before a command can log in to Office 365, it requires a valid access token. Office 365 CLI offers you two methods to obtain a valid access token: Auth.ensureAccessToken and Auth.getAccessToken . While the methods seem similar, they work differently and are meant for different purposes. Refresh access token for the current resource If you're building a command that operates on the same URL, as the service to which the user is connected, you should use the Auth.ensureAccessToken method to refresh the token. Not only does this method resolve to a valid access token, which you can use directly in your code, but also stores the new access- and refresh token in the auth.service object from which you can use in any point in code. For example: you're building a command that retrieves the list of service principals from the Azure Active Directory ( aad sp get ). The command uses the Azure Active Directory Graph API ( https://graph.windows.net ) for this. Since the resource URL of the AAD Graph service ( https://graph.windows.net ) and the URL of the API that the command has to call ( https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/servicePrincipals ) are both located on the same domain https://graph.windows.net , you should call the Auth.ensureAccessToken method to obtain a valid access token for the AAD Graph service, before calling the API. As another example, let's take a method that communicates with the SharePoint Online tenant admin API to set a tenant property ( spo storageentity set ). While using the spo login command, users can log in to any SharePoint site, the spo storageentity set command requires the user to be connected to the SharePoint tenant admin site. As a result, both the URL of the service, to which the user is connected ( https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com ) and the URL of the API used by the service ( https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery ) are located on the same domain https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com , which is why you should call the Auth.ensureAccessToken method to obtain a valid access for the SharePoint Online tenant admin site, before calling the API. Obtain a valid access token for a different resource In some cases, while the user is connected to one service (with a corresponding resource), you need to retrieve a valid access token for a different resource. This is often the case when building SharePoint commands. In Office 365, SharePoint resources are spread over the following different domains: contoso-admin.sharepoint.com - which hosts the SharePoint Online tenant admin site, contoso.sharepoint.com - which hosts regular SharePoint sites and contoso-my.sharepoint.com - which hosts users' OneDrive sites. From Azure Active Directory point of view, all these domains are perceived as separate resources and require different access tokens. If you're building a command that allows users to specify a URL on which the operation should be performed, such as spo app install , you cannot make any assumptions of the service to which they're connected, and you should obtain a valid access token for the resources corresponding to the URL specified by the user, using the Auth.getResourceToken method. While the Auth.getResourceToken method also returns a valid access token for the specified resource, it doesn't update the connection information on the auth.service object. Why two different methods to get tokens In the Office 365 CLI, logging in to Office 365 services is interactive and requires user input. If commands relied on context information from the site, to which users are logged in, it would be impossible to build scripts using the Office 365 CLI commands.

Not only does this method resolve to a valid access token, which you can use directly in your code, but also stores the new access- and refresh token in the auth.service object from which you can use in any point in code. For example: you're building a command that retrieves the list of service principals from the Azure Active Directory ( aad sp get ). The command uses the Azure Active Directory Graph API ( https://graph.windows.net ) for this. Since the resource URL of the AAD Graph service ( https://graph.windows.net ) and the URL of the API that the command has to call ( https://graph.windows.net/myorganization/servicePrincipals ) are both located on the same domain https://graph.windows.net , you should call the Auth.ensureAccessToken method to obtain a valid access token for the AAD Graph service, before calling the API. As another example, let's take a method that communicates with the SharePoint Online tenant admin API to set a tenant property ( spo storageentity set ). While using the spo login command, users can log in to any SharePoint site, the spo storageentity set command requires the user to be connected to the SharePoint tenant admin site. As a result, both the URL of the service, to which the user is connected ( https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com ) and the URL of the API used by the service ( https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com/_vti_bin/client.svc/ProcessQuery ) are located on the same domain https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com , which is why you should call the Auth.ensureAccessToken method to obtain a valid access for the SharePoint Online tenant admin site, before calling the API.","title":"Refresh access token for the current resource"},{"location":"concepts/authorization-tokens/#obtain-a-valid-access-token-for-a-different-resource","text":"In some cases, while the user is connected to one service (with a corresponding resource), you need to retrieve a valid access token for a different resource.

From Azure Active Directory point of view, all these domains are perceived as separate resources and require different access tokens. If you're building a command that allows users to specify a URL on which the operation should be performed, such as spo app install , you cannot make any assumptions of the service to which they're connected, and you should obtain a valid access token for the resources corresponding to the URL specified by the user, using the Auth.getResourceToken method.

Depending how you're using the Office 365 CLI, some additional setup might be required to enable command completion. Immersive mode One way to use the Office 365 CLI is to start it in the immersive mode. By typing in your shell o365 or office365 , you start the Office 365 CLI and your command prompt changes to o365$ . At that point, the Office 365 CLI takes over your shell and interprets all of your input. To complete the command you're typing, simply start typing the word and press TAB . To see the list of available commands, matching your input, press TAB twice. Non-immersive mode When using the Office 365 CLI in the non-immersive mode, you execute complete Office 365 CLI commands in your shell. Rather than starting the Office 365 CLI by typing o365 or office365 , you type the whole command, like o365 spo app list .

Zsh, Bash and Fish If you're using Zsh, Bash or Fish as your shell, you can benefit of Office 365 CLI command completion as well, when typing commands directly in the shell. The completion is based on the Omelette package. Enable sh completion To enable completion: Start your shell Execute o365 --completion:sh:setup . This will generate the commands.json file in the same folder where the Office 365 CLI is installed, listing all available commands and their options. Additionally, it will register completion in your shell profile file (for Zsh ~/.zshrc ) using the Omelette's automated install .

Why is persisting connection information important Persisting connection information is important for two reasons. Convenience First of all it's more convenient to use the Office 365 CLI. If you're using it often to manage a specific tenant, you can connect once and the CLI will remember your credentials. The next time you start the CLI, you can directly start managing your tenant without having to authenticate first. Building scripts Additionally, it makes it possible for you to write scripts that automate management of your tenant. When the Office 365 CLI is run in immersive (interactive) mode, the connection information is persisted in memory and is available to all commands run in the CLI command prompt. Unfortunately, one limitation of the immersive mode is that you can only run one command at a time and can't pass the output of one command into another. When running in the non-immersive (non-interactive) mode, each command is executed in an isolated context and has no access to the memory of any command executed before. So unless you would store the connection information in a variable and explicitly pass it to each command, the CLI would be unable to log in to your tenant. As you can imagine, working with the CLI in this way would be tedious and inconvenient. By persisting the connection information the Office 365 CLI can be used to build scripts, for example: Deploy all apps that are not yet deployed in the tenant app catalog: # get all apps available in the tenant app catalog apps = $( o365 spo app list -o json ) # get IDs of all apps that are not deployed notDeployedAppsIds =( $( echo $apps | jq -r .[] | select(.Deployed == false) | {ID} | .[] ) ) # deploy all not deployed apps for appId in $notDeployedAppsIds ; do o365 spo app deploy -i $appId done First, you use the Office 365 CLI to get the list of all apps from the tenant app catalog using the spo app list command. You set the output type to JSON and store it in a shell variable apps . Next, you parse the JSON string using jq and get IDs of apps that are not deployed. Finally, for each ID you run the spo app deploy Office 365 CLI command passing the ID as a command argument. Notice, that in the script, both spo commands are run as separate commands directly in the shell. In both cases, the shell starts the CLI, executes the specified command and closes the CLI removing all of its resources from memory. Scripts, like the one mentioned above can work, because the Office 365 CLI persists its connection information. Persisting connection information in Office 365 CLI When you log in to an Office 365 service, such as SharePoint Online, in the Office 365 CLI, the CLI will persist the information about the connection for future reuse. For each established connection, the Office 365 CLI persists the following information: service name, eg. SPO Azure AD resource name, eg https://contoso.sharepoint.com refresh token access token access token expiration timestamp Depending on the Office 365 service to which you log in, the Office 365 CLI might persist some additional information. For example, when logging in to SharePoint Online tenant admin site using the spo login command, the CLI will store the tenant ID. If you were initially connected to the tenant admin site, but also performed operations on other site collections (like retrieving the list of apps installed in the specific site), the CLI will store access token for regular SharePoint sites as well. Where the connection information is persisted, depends on the operating system that you are using. macOS On the macOS, the Office 365 CLI persists its connection information in the system Keychain. For each connected Office 365 service (such as SPO ) it adds a generic credential. You can view what information is stored by opening Keychain Access and searching for Office 365 CLI . Windows On Windows, the Office 365 CLI persists its connection information in the Windows Credential Manager. To view the persisted credentials, from the Control Panel , navigate to User Accounts and from the Credential Manager section open Manage Windows Credentials . Any credentials stored by the Office 365 CLI will be listed in the Generic Credentials section named as [service]--x-y , for example SPO--1-3 . Because there is a limit how long a password stored in the Windows Credential Manager can be, connection information stored by the Office 365 CLI will often be split over multiple chunks, where the last two number in the chunk specify the number of chunk and the total number of chunks. Linux On Linux, the Office 365 CLI stores its connection information in a JSON file located at ~/.o365cli-tokens.json . The contents of this file are not encrypted. The primary use case for supporting Linux operating system is to use the Office 365 CLI in Docker containers, where the tokens file is persisted in the container as long as the container is running. When the container is closed and removed, the file is removed as well. When you would start the container again, you would have to log in to Office 365 first, before you could use the Office 365 CLI. Removing persisted connection information Office 365 CLI persists its connection information until you either explicitly log out from the particular service or manually remove the stored credentials. To check if you are logged in to a particular Office 365 service in the Office 365 CLI, run the corresponding status command, for example o365 spo status . If you are logged in, the command will return the URL of the site to which you are logged in. If you are not connected, the command will return false . To log out from the specific Office 365 service, run the corresponding Office 365 CLI, for example, to log out from SharePoint Online and remove all persisted connection information, run o365 spo logout .","title":"Persisting connection"},{"location":"concepts/persisting-connection/#persisting-connection-information","text":"After logging in to an Office 365 service, like SharePoint Online, the Office 365 CLI will persist the information about the connection until you explicitly log out from the specific service.","title":"Persisting connection information"},{"location":"concepts/persisting-connection/#why-is-persisting-connection-information-important","text":"Persisting connection information is important for two reasons.","title":"Why is persisting connection information important"},{"location":"concepts/persisting-connection/#convenience","text":"First of all it's more convenient to use the Office 365 CLI.

Following is information on these two output modes along with information when to use which. Choose the command output mode All commands in Office 365 CLI can present their output as plain-text or as JSON. By default, all commands use the text output mode, but by setting the --output , or -o for short, option to json , you can change the output mode for that command to JSON. Text output mode By default, all commands in Office 365 CLI present their output as plain-text. Depending on the command output, the value is presented as-is or formatted for readability. Simple values If the command output is a simple value, such as a number, boolean or a string, the value is returned as-is. For example, if the Office 365 Public CDN is enabled on the currently connected tenant, executing the spo cdn get command, will return true : $ o365 spo cdn get true Objects If the command returns information about an object such as a site, list or an app, that contains a number of properties, the output in text mode is formatted as key-value pairs. For example, getting information about a specific app, will return output similar to: $ o365 spo app get -i e6362993-d4fd-4c5a-8254-fd095a7291ad AppCatalogVersion : 1 .0.0.0 CanUpgrade : false CurrentVersionDeployed: false Deployed : false ID : e6362993-d4fd-4c5a-8254-fd095a7291ad InstalledVersion : IsClientSideSolution : true Title : spfx-140-online-client-side-solution Arrays If the command returns information about multiple objects, the output is formatted as a table.

This is invaluable when building scripts using the CLI, where the output of one command, has to be processed by another command. Simple values Simple values in JSON output, are returned as-is. For example, if the Office 365 Public CDN is enabled on the currently connected tenant, executing the spo cdn get command, will return true : $ o365 spo cdn get -o json true Objects If the command returns an object, that object will be formatted as a JSON string. For example, getting information about a specific app, will return output similar to: $ o365 spo app get -i e6362993-d4fd-4c5a-8254-fd095a7291ad { AppCatalogVersion : 1.0.0.0 , CanUpgrade :false, CurrentVersionDeployed :false, Deployed :false, ID : e6362993-d4fd-4c5a-8254-fd095a7291ad , InstalledVersion : , IsClientSideSolution :true, Title : spfx-140-online-client-side-solution } Arrays If the command returns information about multiple objects, the command will return a JSON array with each array item representing one object. For example, getting the list of available app, will return output similar to: $ o365 spo app list -o json [{ AppCatalogVersion : 1.0.0.0 , CanUpgrade :false, CurrentVersionDeployed :false, Deployed :false, ID : e6362993-d4fd-4c5a-8254-fd095a7291ad , InstalledVersion : , IsClientSideSolution :true, Title : spfx-140-online-client-side-solution } , { AppCatalogVersion : 1.0.0.0 , CanUpgrade :false, CurrentVersionDeployed :false, Deployed :false, ID : 5ae74650-b00b-46a9-925f-9c9bd70a0cb6 , InstalledVersion : , IsClientSideSolution :true, Title : spfx-134-client-side-solution }] Even if the array contains only one item, for consistency it will be returned as a one-element JSON array: $ o365 spo app list -o json [{ AppCatalogVersion : 1.0.0.0 , CanUpgrade :false, CurrentVersionDeployed :false, Deployed :false, ID : e6362993-d4fd-4c5a-8254-fd095a7291ad , InstalledVersion : , IsClientSideSolution :true, Title : spfx-140-online-client-side-solution }] Tip Some list commands return different output in text and JSON mode. For readability, in the text mode they only include a few properties, so that the output can be formatted as a table and will fit on the screen. In JSON mode however, they will include all available properties so that it's possible to process the full set of information about the particular object. For more details, refer to the help of the particular command. Verbose and debug output in JSON mode When executing commands in JSON output mode with the --verbose or --debug flag, the verbose and debug logging statements will be also formatted as JSON and will be added to the output. When processing the command output, you would have to determine yourself which of the returned JSON objects represents the actual command result and which are additional verbose and debug logging statements. When to use which output mode Generally, you will use the default text output when interacting with the CLI yourself. When building scripts using the Office 365 CLI, you will use the JSON output mode, because processing JSON strings is much more convenient and reliable than processing plain-text output. Sample script Using the JSON output mode allows you to build scripts using the Office 365 CLI. The CLI works on any platform, but as there is no common way to work with objects and command output on all platforms and shells, we chose JSON as the format to serialize objects in the Office 365 CLI. Following, is a sample script, that you could build using the Office 365 CLI in Bash: # get all apps available in the tenant app catalog apps = $( o365 spo app list -o json ) # get IDs of all apps that are not deployed notDeployedAppsIds =( $( echo $apps | jq -r .[] | select(.Deployed == false) | {ID} | .[] ) ) # deploy all not deployed apps for appId in $notDeployedAppsIds ; do o365 spo app deploy -i $appId done First, you use the Office 365 CLI to get the list of all apps from the tenant app catalog using the spo app list command. You set the output type to JSON and store it in a shell variable apps . Next, you parse the JSON string using jq and get IDs of apps that are not deployed. Finally, for each ID you run the spo app deploy Office 365 CLI command passing the ID as a command argument. Notice, that in the script, both spo commands are prepended with o365 and executed as separate commands directly in the shell. The same could be accomplished in PowerShell as well: # get all apps available in the tenant app catalog $apps = o365 spo app list -o json | ConvertFrom-Json # get all apps that are not yet deployed and deploy them $apps | ? Deployed -eq $false | % { o365 spo app deploy -i $_ . ID } Because PowerShell offers native support for working with JSON strings and objects, the same script written in PowerShell is simpler than the one in Bash. At the end of the day it's up to you to choose if you want to use the Office 365 CLI in Bash, PowerShell or some other shell. Both Bash and PowerShell are available on multiple platforms, and if you have a team using different platforms, writing scripts using Office 365 CLI in Bash or PowerShell will let everyone in your team use them.","title":"CLI output mode"},{"location":"user-guide/cli-output-mode/#office-365-cli-output-mode","text":"Office 365 CLI commands can present their output either as plain-text or as JSON.

Following section explains how you can log in and check the Office 365 login status. Office 365 services Using the Office 365 CLI you can manage different areas of an Office 365 tenant. Currently, commands for working with SharePoint Online, Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Graph and the Azure Management Service are available, but more commands for other services will be added in the future. Commands in the Office 365 CLI are organized into services. For example, all commands that manage SharePoint Online begin with spo ( spo app list , spo cdn get , etc.) and commands for working with the Azure AD begin with aad . For each Office 365 service, the CLI offers three commands for managing the login with that service. Log in to an Office 365 service Office 365 CLI offers you a number of ways to log in to Office 365 services in your tenant. Log in using the default device code flow The default way to log in to an Office 365 service using the Office 365 CLI is through the device code flow. To log in to an Office 365 service, use the service login command for that service. For example, to log in to SharePoint Online, execute: spo login https://contoso.sharepoint.com To log in to Azure AD, which uses a fixed URL, execute: aad login Tip If the service uses a fixed URL, such as Azure AD or Microsoft Graph, you will execute the login command without any arguments, for example aad login . However, when logging in to other services that require a URL, such as SharePoint, you will execute the login command with the URL to which the CLI should log in to, for example: spo login https://contoso.sharepoint.com . For more information on logging in to each service, refer to the help of the login command for that service. After executing the login command, you will be prompted to navigate to https://aka.ms/devicelogin in your web browser and enter the login code presented to you by the Office 365 CLI in the command line. After entering the code, you will see the prompt that you are about to authenticate the PnP Office 365 Management Shell application to access your tenant on your behalf. If you are using the Office 365 CLI for the first time, you will be also prompted to verify the permissions you are about to grant the Office 365 CLI. This is referred to as consent . The device code flow is the recommended approach for command-line tools to authenticate with resources secured with Azure AD. Because the authentication process is handled in the browser by Azure AD itself, it allows you to benefit of rich security features such as multi-factor authentication or conditional access. The device code flow is interactive and requires user interaction which might be limiting if you want to use the Office 365 CLI in your continuous deployment setup which is fully automated and doesn't involve user interaction. Log in using user name and password An alternative way to log in to an Office 365 service in the Office 365 CLI is by using a user name and password. To use this way of authenticating, set the authType option to password and specify your credentials using the userName and password options. To log in to SharePoint Online using your user name and password, execute: spo login https://contoso.sharepoint.com --authType password --userName user@contoso.com --password pass@word1 To log in to Azure AD using your user name and password, execute: aad login --authType password --userName user@contoso.com --password pass@word1 Using credentials to log in to Office 365 is convenient in automation scenarios where you cannot authenticate interactively. The downside of this way of authenticating is, that it doesn't allow you to use any of the advanced security features that Azure AD offers. If your account for example uses multi-factor authentication, logging in to Office 365 using credentials will fail. Attention When logging in to Office 365 using credentials, Office 365 CLI will persist not only the retrieved access and refresh token, but also the credentials you specified when logging in. This is necessary for the CLI to be able to retrieve a new refresh token, in case the previously retrieved refresh token expired or has been invalidated. Generally, you should use the default device code flow. If you need to use a non-interactive authentication flow, you can authenticate using credentials of an account that has sufficient privileges in your tenant and doesn't have multi-factor authentication or other advanced security features enabled. Check login status To see if you're logged in to the particular Office 365 service and if so, with which account, use the service status command, for example, to see if you're logged in to SharePoint Online, execute: spo status Log out from an Office 365 service To log out from an Office 365 service, use the service logout command for that service. For example, to log out from SharePoint Online, execute: spo logout Tip Each service in the Office 365 CLI manages its login information independently. This makes it possible for you to be logged in to different services with different accounts. Using the service status command you can see which account is currently logged in to the particular service. Logging in to SharePoint Online When logging in to SharePoint Online, you can log in either to the tenant admin site (eg. https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com ) or any other site in your tenant. If you are logged in to the tenant admin site, but would like to get information for some other site, such as the list of its subsites or lists, the CLI will automatically switch to that site, without you having to reauthenticate. Attention Please note, that some commands require login to the tenant admin site, and if you try to execute them, while being logged in to a different site, you will get an error. For more information whether the login to the tenant admin site is required or not, refer to the help of that particular command. Tip The most convenient way of working with the CLI is to log in to the tenant admin site. Based on the options you specified when executing commands, the CLI will automatically switch between the tenant admin site or other sites that you will want to manage. You should log in to other sites only, if you don't have tenant admin privileges and yet would like to automate some of your work using the Office 365 CLI. Authorize with Office 365 To authorize for communicating with Office 365 API, the Office 365 CLI uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol. When using the default device code flow, you authenticate with Azure AD in the web browser. After authenticating, Office 365 CLI will attempt to retrieve a valid access token for the specified Office 365 service. If you have insufficient permissions to access the particular service, authorization will fail with an adequate error. If you authenticate using credentials, the authentication and authorization are a part of the same request that Office 365 CLI issues towards Azure AD. If either authentication or authorization fails, you will see a corresponding error message explaining what went wrong. Re-consent the PnP Office 365 Management Shell Azure AD application Office 365 CLI uses the PnP Office 365 Management Shell Azure AD application to log in to your Office 365 tenant on your behalf. As we add new commands to the CLI, it's possible, that new permissions will be added to the PnP Office 365 Management Shell Azure AD application. To be able to use the newly added commands which depend on these new permissions, you will have to re-approve the PnP Office 365 Management Shell Azure AD application in your Azure AD. This process is also known as re-consenting the Azure AD application . To re-consent the PnP Office 365 Management Shell application in your Azure AD, in the command line execute: o365 --reconsent Office 365 CLI will provide you with a URL that you should open in the web browser and sign in with your organizational account. After authenticating, Azure AD will prompt you to approve the new set of permissions. Once you approved the permissions, you will be redirected to an empty page. You can now use all commands in the Office 365 CLI. Logging in to Office 365 via a proxy All communication between the Office 365 CLI and Office 365 APIs happens via web requests. If you're behind a proxy, you should set up an environment variable to allow Office 365 CLI to log in to Office 365. More information about the necessary configuration steps is available at https://github.com/request/request#controlling-proxy-behaviour-using-environment-variables . Persisted connections After logging in to Office 365, the Office 365 CLI will persist that connection information until you explicitly log out from the particular service. This is necessary to support building scripts using the Office 365 CLI, where each command is executed independently of other commands. Persisted connection contains information about the user name used to establish the connection, the connected Office 365 service URL, the access token and the refresh token. To secure this information from unprivileged access, it's stored securely in the password store specific to the platform on which you're using the CLI. For more information, see the separate article dedicated to persisting connection information in the Office 365 CLI.","title":"Logging in to Office 365"},{"location":"user-guide/connecting-office-365/#logging-in-to-office-365","text":"Before you can use Office 365 CLI commands to manage your tenant, you have to log in to Office 365.

Attention When logging in to Office 365 using credentials, Office 365 CLI will persist not only the retrieved access and refresh token, but also the credentials you specified when logging in. This is necessary for the CLI to be able to retrieve a new refresh token, in case the previously retrieved refresh token expired or has been invalidated. Generally, you should use the default device code flow. If you need to use a non-interactive authentication flow, you can authenticate using credentials of an account that has sufficient privileges in your tenant and doesn't have multi-factor authentication or other advanced security features enabled.","title":"Log in using user name and password"},{"location":"user-guide/connecting-office-365/#check-login-status","text":"To see if you're logged in to the particular Office 365 service and if so, with which account, use the service status command, for example, to see if you're logged in to SharePoint Online, execute: spo status","title":"Check login status"},{"location":"user-guide/connecting-office-365/#log-out-from-an-office-365-service","text":"To log out from an Office 365 service, use the service logout command for that service.

For more information whether the login to the tenant admin site is required or not, refer to the help of that particular command. Tip The most convenient way of working with the CLI is to log in to the tenant admin site. Based on the options you specified when executing commands, the CLI will automatically switch between the tenant admin site or other sites that you will want to manage.

Start the CLI You can use the Office 365 CLI in two modes: immersive, where it launches a separate command prompt, and non-immersive, where you can execute Office 365 CLI commands directly from your shell. Start the CLI in the immersive mode To start Office 365 CLI in the immersive mode, execute in the command line: office365 or for short: o365 In both cases, Office 365 CLI will start a new command prompt where you can directly interact with it and its commands. Info When using the Office 365 CLI in immersive mode, it starts a new command prompt. In this command prompt, you have access only to Office 365 CLI commands. If you try to run any of the system commands, such as ls , you will get an error stating that you tried to execute an unknown command. If you need to use system commands or other CLIs while working with Office 365 CLI, consider using the non-immersive mode instead. The main benefit of using the Office 365 CLI in the immersive mode, is that you have direct access to all commands, without having to prepend them with o365 and that you can have the CLI complete your input by pressing TAB without any additional configuration. To close the Office 365 CLI started in immersive mode, type exit in the CLI prompt. Use the CLI in non-immersive mode Another way to use the Office 365 CLI is by executing specific commands directly from the command line. Attention When using the Office 365 CLI this way, each CLI command must be prepended with office365 or o365 for short. Without this, your shell will not know how the particular command should be executed. Using the Office 365 CLI directly from the command line is invaluable if you want to write scripts consisting of a number of Office 365 CLI and other commands combined together. Additionally, you keep the access to all system commands and other CLIs available on your computer. List available commands To list commands available with the Office 365 CLI type help in the CLI prompt, or o365 help directly in your shell. Commands in the Office 365 CLI are combined into groups. You can list the commands available in the particular group by typing help group , for example help spo to list all commands related to SharePoint Online, or o365 help spo directly in your shell. Get command help Each command in the Office 365 CLI comes with help describing the command's purpose, available options and any other relevant details as well as related resources. To get the basic help information with command's description and available options, type help command or o365 help command in the shell, for example to get help for the spo cdn get command, type in the shell o365 help spo cdn get . To get the complete help information including background information, examples and links to related information, use the --help option, for example o365 spo cdn get --help . This ability is also useful if you've already typed some options and don't want to lose your input but want to access the help, for example: o365 spo cdn get --type Private --help . Required and optional command options Commands in the Office 365 CLI often contain options that determine what the particular command should do. Command options vary from the URL of the site for which you would like to retrieve more information, to the type of Office 365 CDN that you would like to manage. Some options are required and necessary for the particular command to execute, while other are optional. When listing available options for the particular command, Office 365 CLI follows the naming convention where required options are wrapped in angle brackets ( ) while optional options are wrapped in square brackets ( [ ] ). For example, in the spo cdn origin add command, the origin you want to add is required ( -r, --origin origin ), while the type of CDN for which this origin should be added is optional ( -t, --type [type] ) and its value defaults to Public . Values with quotes In cases, when the option's value contains spaces, it should be wrapped in quotes. For example, to create a modern team site for the Office 365 CLI team, you would execute in the shell: o365 spo site add --alias office365cli --title Office 365 CLI When the value, that you want to provide contains quotes, it needs to be wrapped in quotes as well, for example to pass a JSON value in the CLI prompt, you would execute: spo sitescript add --title Contoso --description Contoso theme script --content { abc : def } If you use the Office 365 CLI in Bash, the outer pair of quotes will be processed by Bash so the value needs to be wrapped in an additional pair of quotes, for example: o365 spo sitescript add --title Contoso --description Contoso theme script --content `{ abc : def }` Verbose and debug mode By default, commands output only the information returned by the corresponding Office 365 API, whether the command result or error. You can choose for a more user-friendly output by using the --verbose option or setting the OFFICE365CLI_VERBOSE environment variable to 1 . For example: by default, when checking status of the Office 365 Public CDN, you would see: $ o365 spo cdn get true After adding the --verbose option, the output would change to: $ o365 spo cdn get --verbose Retrieving status of Public CDN... Public CDN at https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com is enabled If you're experiencing problems when using the Office 365 CLI, you can use the --debug option or set the OFFICE365CLI_DEBUG environment variable to 1 . On top of the output from the verbose mode, the debug mode will provide you with detailed information about all requests and responses from the Office 365 APIs used by the command. Command completion To help you use its commands, the Office 365 CLI offers you the ability to complete commands and options that you're typing in the prompt. Depending how you're using the Office 365 CLI, some additional setup might be required to enable command completion. Completion in immersive mode When using the Office 365 CLI in the immersive mode, the CLI prompt helps you complete your input. By pressing the TAB key once, the CLI will complete your current input.
